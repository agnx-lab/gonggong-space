# Retro Zine

Beige paper with green accent and Bebas Neue + Caveat: a riso-printed zine in HTML form.

`example.html` is a finished example of this template — study its structure, density and finish, do not copy its copy.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system and slide vocabulary are tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** light
- **Formality:** medium-low
- **Density:** medium
- **Slides in example:** 10

**Best for:** Anything that should feel printed, lo-fi, and crafted: community and neighbourhood stories, indie publications, music and arts brands, small-batch craft launches, creator portfolios. Also a warm underdog choice for tech or business decks.

**Avoid for:** Contexts that demand digital-native polish or fast modern-tech energy — the layered zine aesthetic intentionally feels handmade.

## Visual system

- **Palette** (`:root` in `example.html`): beige paper `--bg #C8B99A` (dark `#B8A98A`), riso green `--green #008F4D` (light `#00A85D`), ink `#1A1A1A`, off-white `#F4EFE6`.
- **Type:** Bebas Neue for condensed headlines, Caveat for handwritten notes, Space Grotesk for body.
- **Signature:** riso-print layering: green overprint blocks, cut-and-paste collage frames, handwritten margin notes, ruled lines.
- **Slide vocabulary** (example order): `slide-hero`, `slide-split` (editorial), `slide-statement`, `slide-grid` (info grid), `slide-visual` (full visual), `slide-editorial`, `slide-numbers` (numbered features), `slide-collage`, `slide-rsvp`, `slide-closing`.

## Build

1. **Seed:** copy `./example.html` to `design/<slug>/index.html` (it is fully self-contained). This is the only starting point — never write the deck from scratch and never mix in another template's layouts, fonts or colours.
2. **Replace content slide by slide** in this template's own vocabulary: keep each slide's markup and classes, swap in the real headlines, body copy, numbers, names, dates and section labels. Match existing dimensions when swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolour the palette, restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (rules, textures, shapes, illustrated SVGs) — they are the identity.
4. **Adjust length by duplicating layouts.** More content: duplicate the existing slide of the most appropriate layout. Less: drop slides. Update every page number, counter and label to the real count.
5. **Missing layout:** design it from this template's fonts, palette, decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm and component grammar — never bail to a different template.
6. **Strip the example.** Remove its people, organisations, e-mail addresses, URLs, citations and project names; carry over no third-party marks or links.
7. **Chinese.** `<html lang="zh-CN">`, copy in the creation message's language. Every font stack (including the `--f-*` / font variables in `:root`) ends with a Chinese fallback — sans: `"PingFang SC","Noto Sans SC","Microsoft YaHei",sans-serif`; serif: `"Songti SC","Noto Serif SC",serif` (use the serif fallback where the Latin face is a serif). Latin display faces have no CJK glyphs, so check the cover and section headlines with real Chinese text; drop wide letter-spacing and `text-transform: uppercase` tracking on labels that become Chinese (≤ 0.05em).
8. **Runtime.** Navigation is the inline script at the end of the file (←/→, Space and the other keys it already handles). Keep it unmodified; the first slide carries `active`, the script moves it.
9. Add `data-section="<id>"` to every slide.

## Speaker notes

This template has no notes runtime. When notes are requested, put them in `<aside class="notes" hidden>…</aside>` as the last child of each slide — never visible on stage.

## Checklist

- [ ] Every slide is built from this template's vocabulary; no foreign layouts, fonts or colours.
- [ ] No example copy, names, contacts or links remain (search the file for the example's distinctive names).
- [ ] Every font stack has the Chinese fallback; Chinese headlines render well and nothing overflows the 16:9 stage.
- [ ] Page numbers, counters and the table of contents match the real slides.
- [ ] Charts and diagrams are inline SVG / HTML in this palette, with real or clearly marked placeholder figures.
- [ ] `../../craft/anti-ai-slop.md` and `../../craft/typography.md` pass.
